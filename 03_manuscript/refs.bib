              root-associated microbial communities in Arabidopsis thaliana and
              co-occurring grasses at 17 European sites across 3 years. We
              observed strong geographic structuring of the soil biome, but not
              of the root microbiota. A few phylogenetically diverse and
              geographically widespread bacteria consistently colonized plant
              roots. Among-site and across-year similarity in microbial
              community composition was stronger for the bacterial root
              microbiota than for filamentous eukaryotes. In a reciprocal
              transplant between two A. thaliana populations in Sweden and
              Italy, we uncoupled soil from location effects and tested their
              contributions to root microbiota variation and plant adaptation.
              Community differentiation in plant roots was explained primarily
              by location for filamentous eukaryotes and by soil origin for
              bacteria, whereas host genotype effects were marginal. Strong
              local adaptation between the two A. thaliana populations was
              observed, with differences in soil properties and microbes of
              little importance for the observed magnitude of adaptive
              differentiation. Our results suggest that, across large spatial
              scales, climate is more important than soil conditions for plant
              adaptation and variation in root-associated filamentous
              eukaryotic communities, whereas soil properties are primary
              drivers of bacterial community differentiation in roots.",

              which is strongly affected by the strength of seed dormancy.
              Continental-wide genetic variation in seed dormancy has been
              related to differences in climate and the timing of conditions
              suitable for seedling establishment. However, for predictions of
              adaptive potential and consequences of climatic change,
              information is needed regarding the extent to which seed dormancy
              varies within climatic regions and the factors driving such
              variation. We quantified dormancy of seeds produced by 17 Italian
              and 28 Fennoscandian populations of Arabidopsis thaliana when
              grown in the greenhouse and at two field sites in Italy and
              Sweden. To identify possible drivers of among-population
              variation in seed dormancy, we examined the relationship between
              seed dormancy and climate at the site of population origin, and
              between seed dormancy and flowering time. Seed dormancy was on
              average stronger in the Italian compared to the Fennoscandian
              populations, but also varied widely within both regions.
              Estimates of seed dormancy in the three maternal environments
              were positively correlated. Among Fennoscandian populations, seed
              dormancy tended to increase with increasing summer temperature
              and decreasing precipitation at the site of population origin. In
              the smaller sample of Italian populations, no significant
              association was detected between mean seed dormancy and climate
              at the site of origin. The correlation between population mean
              seed dormancy and flowering time was weak and not statistically
              significant within regions. The correlation between seed dormancy
              and climatic factors in Fennoscandia suggests that at least some
              of the among-population variation is adaptive and that climate
              change will affect selection on this trait. The weak correlation
              between population mean seed dormancy and flowering time
              indicates that the two traits can evolve independently.",

              the importance of biotic interactions-is unclear. Biotic
              interactions should drive local adaptation when they impose
              consistent divergent selection; if this is common, we expect
              transplant experiments to detect more frequent and stronger local

              this hypothesis using a meta-analysis of transplant experiments

              was common, and biotic interactions affected fitness.
              Nevertheless, local adaptation was neither more common nor

              may promote local adaptation more often in tropical than in
              temperate ecosystems, although few tropical studies were

              interactions often fail to drive local adaptation even though
              they strongly affect fitness, perhaps because temperate biotic

              adaptation. In this study, we examine genetic variation in traits
              covering the major life history events of the annual species
              Arabidopsis thaliana: seed dormancy, vegetative growth rate and
              flowering time. In a sample of 112 genotypes collected throughout
              the European range of the species, both seed dormancy and
              flowering time follow a latitudinal gradient independent of the
              major population structure gradient. This finding confirms
              previous studies reporting the adaptive evolution of these two
              traits. Here, however, we further analyze patterns of

              follows a latitudinal cline. At higher latitudes, vegetative
              growth rate is positively correlated with primary dormancy and

              disappears. Patterns of trait co-variation change, presumably
              because major environmental gradients shift with latitude. This
              pattern appears unrelated to population structure, suggesting
              that changes in the coordinated evolution of major life history
              traits is adaptive. Our data suggest that A. thaliana provides a

              of traits that increase the amount of resources available to
              individuals (their resource status or 'condition'). We examined
              the relative contribution of trade-offs and increased condition
              to adaptive evolution in a recombinant inbred line population of
              Arabidopsis thaliana planted at the native sites of the parental
              ecotypes in Italy and Sweden in 2 years. We estimated genetic
              correlations among fitness components based on genotypic means

              produced more seeds per fruit than did the non-local ecotype,

              map to the same regions of the genome and showed positive

              this system suited for the rapid molecular dissection of
              evolutionary mechanisms. In a large-scale genomic analysis of
              Catalonian A. thaliana, we resequenced 77 individuals from
              multiple salinity gradients along the coast and integrated these
              data with 1,135 worldwide A. thaliana genomes for a detailed
              understanding of the demographic and evolutionary dynamics of
              naturally evolved salinity tolerance. This revealed that
              Catalonian varieties adapted to highly fluctuating soil salinity
              are not Iberian relicts but instead have immigrated to this

              alleles undergoing fluctuating selection in response to seasonal
              changes in soil salinity. Plants harboring alleles responsible
              for low root expression of HKT1;1 and consequently high leaf

              into areas where soil sodium levels fluctuate widely due to
              geography and rainfall variation. We demonstrate that the
              proportion of plants harboring HKT1;1HLS alleles correlates with
              soil sodium level over time, HKT1;1HLS -harboring plants are

              HKT1;1HLS allele clusters with high-sodium accumulator accessions

              Reciprocal field-based transplants on soils with elevated

              trade-offs? Here we address these questions in the
              self-pollinating, annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We used 400
              recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two locally adapted
              populations in Italy and Sweden, grew the RILs and parents at the
              parental locations, and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for
              mean fitness (fruits/seedling planted). We previously published
              results from the first 3 years of the study, and here add five
              additional years, providing a unique opportunity to assess how
              temporal variation in selection might affect QTL detection and
              classification. We found 10 adaptive and one maladaptive QTL in
              Italy, and six adaptive and four maladaptive QTL in Sweden. The
              discovery of maladaptive QTL at both sites suggests that even
              locally adapted populations are not always at their genotypic
              optimum. Mean effect sizes for adaptive QTL, 0.97 and 0.55 fruits

              mean fitness of the RILs (approximately 8 fruits/seedling planted
              at both sites). Both genetic trade-offs (four cases) and
              conditional neutrality (seven cases) contribute to local
              adaptation in this system. The 8-year dataset provided greater
              power to detect QTL and to estimate their locations compared to
              our previous 3-year study, identifying one new genetic trade-off

              adaptation, but the relative importance of abiotic and biotic
              factors in driving population divergence remains poorly
              understood. To address this gap, we combined a quantitative
              meta-analysis and a qualitative metasynthesis to (1) quantify the
              magnitude of local adaptation to abiotic and biotic factors and
              (2) characterize major themes that influence the motivation and
              design of experiments that seek to test for local adaptation.
              Using local-foreign contrasts as a metric of local adaptation (or

              presence than in the absence of a biotic interactor, especially

              effects on fitness than abiotic environments when ignoring

              biotic effects were stronger at low latitudes, and abiotic

              components at the native field sites by comparing near-isogenic
              lines with alternate genotypes of CBF2 to their genetic
              background ecotypes. The effects of CBF2 were validated at the
              nucleotide level using gene-edited lines in the native genetic
              backgrounds grown in simulated parental environments. The foreign
              CBF2 genotype in the local genetic background reduced long-term
              mean fitness in Sweden by more than 10\%, primarily via effects
              on survival. In Italy, fitness was reduced by more than 20\%,
              primarily via effects on fecundity. At both sites, the effects
              were temporally variable and much stronger in some years. The
              gene-edited lines confirmed that CBF2 encodes the causal variant
              underlying this genetic trade-off. Additionally, we demonstrated
              a substantial fitness cost of cold acclimation, which has broad
              implications for potential maladaptive responses to climate
              change.",

              microbiome variation and local adaptation in plants requires an
              experimental approach to uncouple their effects and test for
              causality. We used microbial inocula, soil matrices and plant
              genotypes derived from two natural Arabidopsis thaliana
              populations in northern and southern Europe in an experiment
              conducted in climatic chambers mimicking seasonal changes in
              temperature, day length and light intensity of the home sites of
              the two genotypes. The southern A. thaliana genotype outperformed
              the northern genotype in the southern climate chamber, whereas
              the opposite was true in the northern climate chamber. Recipient
              soil matrix, but not microbial composition, affected plant
              fitness, and effects did not differ between genotypes.
              Differences between chambers significantly affected rhizosphere
              microbiome assembly, although these effects were small in
              comparison with the shifts induced by physicochemical differences
              between soil matrices. The results suggest that differences in
              seasonal changes in temperature, day length and light intensity
              between northern and southern Europe have strongly influenced
              adaptive differentiation between the two A. thaliana populations,
              whereas effects of differences in soil factors have been weak. By
              contrast, below-ground differences in soil characteristics were
              more important than differences in climate for rhizosphere
              microbiome differentiation.",
